public class RectangularCuboid extends Shape3D {

    //If the dimensions of a rectangular cuboid are a, b and c, then its volume is abc and its surface area is 2ab + 2ac + 2bc.
    
    //By Euler's formula the numbers of faces F, of vertices V, and of edges E of any convex polyhedron are related by the formula
    //F + V = E + 2. In the case of a cuboid this gives 6 + 8  = 12 + 2; that is, like a cube, a cuboid has 6 faces, 8 vertices, and 12 edges.
